I found that you have to use linux, not windows or MacOS. So you can use some tools from tensorflow.

10 years ago, I found it was hard to install all the packages and work well.
Now I found the same.

Luckly now we have ChatGPT. It really helps me from a lot of stressing.

OK. Here was the things useful. 

1. Install the stable version of Linux.

2. Install the old version of Linux Core. Old enough beacuse CUDA doesn't support lots of new versions.

3. Install the old version of GPU Driver. Also beacuse of CUDA. 

4. Install old version of Python. Do not over python 3.11. I used python3.10 and worked well. 2025.

You definitely need some luck in deep learning. So good luck. 

New journey. Have fun.
